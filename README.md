## 10. Debugging in VS Code:
  ### Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

#### Steps to Set Up and Start Debugging in VS Code

1. Install VS Code:
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code from [the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Install Necessary Extensions:
   - Depending on the programming language you are using, install the relevant extension(s). For example:
     - Python: "Python" extension by Microsoft
     - JavaScript/TypeScript: Built-in support, but you can also install extensions like "ESLint" for linting.

3. Open or Create a Project:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Open your project folder by navigating to `File` > `Open Folder` and selecting your project directory.

4. Configure the Debugger:
   - Open the debug view by clicking on the debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
   - Click on the gear icon to open the launch.json file, which is where you configure your debugging settings.
   - VS Code may automatically generate a `launch.json` file based on the opened project and installed extensions. If not, you can create one manually by selecting the type of environment (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).
   - A basic `launch.json` configuration for a Node.js application might look like this:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
         {
           "type": "node",
           "request": "launch",
           "name": "Launch Program",
           "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
           "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

5. Set Breakpoints:
   - Open the file you want to debug.
   - Click in the gutter to the left of the line numbers to set breakpoints. A red dot will appear, indicating where execution will pause.

6. Start Debugging:
   - Ensure your program is ready to run.
   - In the debug view, select the configuration you want to use (e.g., "Launch Program").
   - Click the green play button or press `F5` to start debugging.

#### Key Debugging Features in VS Code

1. Breakpoints:
   - Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines.
   - Conditional breakpoints and log points can be used to break or log messages when certain conditions are met.

2. Watch Expressions:
   - Add watch expressions to track variable values or evaluate expressions in real-time while debugging.

3. Call Stack:
   - View the call stack to understand the sequence of function calls that led to the current point of execution.

4. Variable Inspection:
   - Inspect variables and their values in the current scope.
   - Hover over variables in the code to see their values.

5. Step Controls:
   - Step over (`F10`), step into (`F11`), and step out (`Shift+F11`) to navigate through the code execution line by line or function by function.

6. Debug Console:
   - Execute code and evaluate expressions within the context of the current debugging session.

7. Integrated Terminal:
   - Run terminal commands without leaving the editor, useful for running build or test scripts.

8. Exception Handling:
   - Configure how VS Code handles exceptions, such as breaking on uncaught exceptions or on all exceptions.

9. Debugging Multiple Threads/Processes:
   - Debug multi-threaded or multi-process applications by configuring compound launch configurations.

10. Remote Debugging:
    - Debug applications running on a different machine by setting up remote debugging configurations.

## 11. Using Source Control:
  ### How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

#### 1. Initialize a Git Repository

- Open the project folder in VS Code that you want to manage with Git.

- Open the terminal in VS Code by navigating to `View` > `Terminal` or using the shortcut `` Ctrl+` ``.
   - Initialize a new Git repository by running the command:
     ```sh
     git init
     ```
   - This creates a `.git` directory in your project folder.

- Alternatively, you can initialize a Git repository by clicking on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
   - Click the `Initialize Repository` button.

#### 2. Stage Changes and Make Commits

- Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar.
   - You will see a list of changed files in your workspace.
   - Hover over a file and click the `+` icon to stage it, or click the `+` icon next to `Changes` to stage all changes.

- After staging the changes, enter a commit message in the text box at the top of the Source Control view.
   - Click the checkmark icon or press `Ctrl+Enter` to commit the changes.
   - The committed changes will now move to the `Commits` section.

#### 3. Connect to GitHub and Push Changes

- Create a new repository on GitHub by navigating to GitHub and clicking on the `New` button.
   - Follow the prompts to create the repository and do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license (since you already have a local repository).

- Copy the repository URL from GitHub.
   - In the terminal, add the remote repository:
     ```sh
     git remote add origin <repository-url>
     ```
   - Verify the remote has been added:
     ```sh
     git remote -v
     ```

- Push the local commits to the GitHub repository by running:
     ```sh
     git push -u origin master
     ```
   - This pushes the changes to the `master` branch and sets the remote `origin` as the default upstream repository.

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by 1st July
